## Introduction
Hi, I'm **Nicole Lopez**!
I am a UI & Interactive Designer who aims to spread happiness through design :^)

I'm currently a a 4th year New Media Design student with minors in Game Design and the Japanese Language at Rochester Institute of Technology, and I will be graduating in May 2021. I'm currently searching for a full-time position in a design field starting in summer 2021!

Whether it’s logos, posters, animations, websites, applications, or games, I have a strong passion to design. My main goal is to create designs that make people happy! In other words, I want to design things that bring enjoyment to others by making things more usable, making things more fun, and of course, making things look more beautiful.

To be honest, I’m a little shy, but once you get to know me, I’m actually a bit of a nerd. I love playing video games and watching Japanese anime. I also enjoy singing songs in both English and Japanese, so I’m always down for a karaoke party!
