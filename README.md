## Introduction
Hi, I'm **Nicole Lopez**!
I am a Visual & Interactive Designer who aims to spread happiness through design!

I'm a recent graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology and I majored in New Media Design student with minors in Game Design and the Japanese Language. I'm currently searching for a full-time position in a design field starting in summer or fall 2021!

Whether itâ€™s logos, posters, animations, websites, applications, or games, I have a strong passion to design. My main goal is to create designs that make people happy! In other words, I want to design things that bring enjoyment to others by making things more usable, making things more fun, and of course, making things look more beautiful.

I designed and coded my entire website by hand (or should I say mouse and keyboard)!
