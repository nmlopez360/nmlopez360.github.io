## Introduction
Hi, I'm **Nicole Lopez**!
I am a Marketing & Interactive Designer who aims to spread happiness through design!

I’ve been working at Playdots, a mobile game company under Zynga and Take-Two Interactive, as a marketing designer. Before that, I was graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2021 where I studied New Media Design with minors in the Japanese language as well as Game Design.

**I'm searching for a new full-time position in the field of design and am available to start in January 2023.**

Whether it’s logos, posters, animations, websites, applications, or games, I have a strong passion to design. My main goal is to create designs that make people happy! In other words, I want to design things that bring enjoyment to others by making things more usable, making things more fun, and of course, making things look more beautiful.

I designed and coded my entire website by hand (or should I say mouse and keyboard)!
